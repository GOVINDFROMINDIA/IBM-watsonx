Time will tell.\\\\n4: Easy Set up and ease of use. Many settings for different clothes and soil settings. Capacity is great, perfect for a family. I did have an issue with the hot water fill not shutting off. After running 6 to 8 loads, this issue resolved itself. Moderately quiet washer as well. Very happy with purchase.\\\\n5: Love the large capacity, the inverter feature instead of the agitator and how quickly it washes!

It is quite and goes through all the cycles pretty fast. My clothes are so clean. I couldn't be happier!\\\\n2: Cleans great, a lot bigger in the inside than I was expecting. Happy customer!\\\\n3: I am very impressed! Great price point and my clothes are washing and drying so well. Very satisfied with this purchase!\\\\n4: Have been using it for a month and I love it way more than the fancy expensive machine on the market! My clothes get clean, it's not loud, and I really love it.\\\\n5: Clothes get so clean and smell so wonderful! I love this washing machine. I prefer the agitator any day over the more modern washing machines. It does a fantastic job\\\\n6: I\\u2019ve only had it for a month but very satisfied so far.\\\\n7: Does a great job on my family\\u2019s clothes. Easy to use and very good looking.\\\\n8: I have owned my new washer for about a week. Everything went well about the installation and the washer cleans clothes so well! Very efficient use of water as well. It seems to be a good washer especially since it is priced so reasonably priced!\\\\n9: It washes and spins your clothes out so very well that it only needs one drying cycle!! Saves time doing laundry and excellent washing!!\\\\n10: This has been an excellent, quality appliance that was reasonable priced. The features are easy to use , along with an agitator, the clothes are well cleaned. The clothes almost spin out dry.\\\\n\",\n          \"1: Works great! No leaks, sturdy build, relatively quiet, and efficient.\\\\n2: This washer is amazing!! No center piece that clothes can get tangled on, and very spacious. The wash is efficient, quiet, and very good. I have never had a washer like this, and I\\u2019m so glad I have one now. I can put in very large loads and absolutely everything gets cleaned. Amazing!\\\\n3: We couldn't be happier with this washer. It has all the features we could possibly want or need at any price. Although I initially wanted to get a front load washer, this model is very water and energy efficient with HUGE capacity for the largest comforter we own. Our previous washer had an agitator that loved to eat the pull cords on shorts and sweat pants, and destroy fine lingerie. The impeller design in this model works every bit as well, without the damage to our clothing. It's extremely quiet, too - which is great since we have a small home. And.. the problem with front loaders is they make a mess if you open them after starting a load. We shopped around and did a lot of research, and after finding this model, we were more than pleased to discover that PQR products are still made in the USA - buy American!!!\\\\n\",\n          \"1: So far I am very happy no issues easy to work and has done a great job washing our clothes the black stainless is so beautiful and the machines seams very sturdy\\\\n2: I bought this machine almost a year and work perfect and easy to use.\\\\n3: Easy to use, quiet, gets the job done effortlessly.\\\\n4: I purchased my washer 7 months ago and I'm impressed with how compact it is but I'm able to wash larger loads and it cleans the clothes as well overall it's an awesome product.\\\\n5: Its easy to use, it cleans perfectly and it doesn\\u2019t even make any noise! I really recommend it!\\\\n6: It is easy to use and cleans the laundry well.\\\\n7: It runs quite and easy to clran\\\\n8: So far so good, installed today and used twice already. My washer/dryer hookup is in the kitchen and this is pretty quiet which is a plus.\\\\n9: Work on cleaning my clothes very well. It spins out water completely. I\\u2019m happy I purchased this machine. Save water as it only uses what\\u2019s needed for cloths.\\\\n10: I bought this machine a few months ago and am very happy with it overall. There are enough options for the settings to choose from to fit all my needs...whites, actives, beddings etc, I also like the Self Clean reminder. I don't have to worry about keeping track of when I last did the cleaning. It uses less water than my previous machine and is pretty quiet. I would highly recomment it.\\\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Features customers liked about the product: 1.
