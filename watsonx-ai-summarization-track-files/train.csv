It has no BAKE option and I don’t know what to do with convection. The other options are Air Grill and Broil. I will get used to it and it will be ok, but it’s a big learning curve for me.\n8: Easy install looks really good in the cabinet.\n9: Easy install, great oven for the price.

"1: Took some time to get cold but other then that it's great for the money\n2: Pretty nice cute looking functional refrigerator - needed for overflow of thanksgiving and Christmas food- and it worked out just fine!

"1: Welbilt but wait wait fridge and freezer both work great\n2: It is a great size and look for office. The freezer is small but very adequate. Very nice. I would purchase it again, if I had a choice.\n3: This small fridge and freezer is amazing! We have it in our outdoor kitchen, under a cover and it really works well outdoors. It holds our beer, seltzers and other drinks. They are always super cold!\n4: This refrigerator has been in use as a spare for 1 month & Control set on 2.9 it still maintains 35-40 degree, freezer -5 to 0. It is very quiet. It is a manual defrost and so far only has small amount of frost on the insides of the freezer.\n5: I run this refer on my generator for 12 hours on house power. Then a 1500 watt ups unit with a pair of paralleled 12volt 50amp batteries for 12 hours. True, I do keep the interior temperature of the refrigerator box at 45 degrees and the freezer compartment at 10 degrees over-night for now. I am seeing how this off the grid setup works in my remote cabin. 7.4 cuft holds enough food for 2 people for 10 days of remote off-the-grid living...\n6: This fridge was the perfect size for extra food storage in our basement. The separate freezer is great. We live in an old house and had to go with a counter depth fridge for our main refrigerator. The extra space was needed to accommodate our food storage needs.\n7: I had a small dorm fridge and needed more but only had space for a dorm size. This is perfect! Same width, separate freezer, lots more room! I am HaPpY!! Plus, EFG delivered it in 2 days from my purchase.\n8: Over all, I'm happy with the purchase which I bought to replace a similar refrigerator on my boat. The old one had a larger freezer capacity which I liked but the DFR was one of the few choices that fit. Unfortunately, there was a dent in the side of the refrigerator that went unnoticed until I opened the box. Because it wasn't practical to take it back to the store so I will live with it.\n9: I had a DFR mini fridge before and it worked very well for many years. When it died I knew exactly what I wanted to replace it. Works wonderfully as a fridge and freezer should. Great if you're downsizing, living in a studio apartment, or need a personal fridge in your room, RV or skoolie. I did notice some carelessness and stripped screws in the assembly when i switched the doors' opening direction but it's not something you'll really notice. Still a great fridge.\n10: Wanted to rate this as excellent but there was a dent on one side from the stores mishandling. Other than that its a great frig for my sons bedroom. The perfect size too for his sodas and snacks and a nice little freezer or ice.\n","Features customers liked about the product: 1. Both the fridge and freezer work great. 2.
