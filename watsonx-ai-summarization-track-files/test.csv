"1: (This review was collected as part of a promotion.) We bought the washer and dryer just before Christmas, and my wife and I are very happy with the machines. My king size blanket fits in the washer nicely and comes out clean ,\n2: Replaced old JKL washer with this and it is so much better! The top load takes up space where we had hangers hanging from the racks, but it is SO much easier on the back!\n3: I bought this a month ago and we love it. Super easy to load with the impeller instead of an agitator. Very quiet smooth running machine. Always love to own a PQR, stylish and sleek looking washer\n4: I have this washer about 2 months and it is the best washing machine I have ever bought. It uses less water and still gets the clothes perfectly clean. It even uses less detergent.\n5: We purchased this washer to replace an old PQR that bit the dust. I love the way it looks- very sleek design and the glass lid is such a cool feature. My 5 and 3 year old beg to watch the machine do it’s thing and, even as an adult, I find myself fascinated by finally seeing what goes on under the lid. It couldn’t be simpler to use and I like the fact that you can see details on each wash cycle option online (no lengthy instruction booklet to try not to lose). I do laundry daily and so far I’d say it does a good job with my regular fare. Clothes, sheets, and towels are all coming out clean and without issue. The machine is fairly quiet and there’s tons of room inside.\n6: This washing machine is a God sent.We were so happy that we bought another PQR washer, as our old one of 20 years finally decided to go. We didn't think that we would get the machine in just 2 day delivery, boy were we Happy. We are seniors and dreaded to go to the laundromat. This PQR gives us great service, as it does clean our clothes with no problem. The machine is easy to load, easy to put the soap and softener in, has a separate bleach holder, and uses less water then any other machine.also it is quiet, it was well worth the money we spent.We are happy that we got another PQR and know that it will last a long time. Thank you very much\n7: It took a little training to get used to a washer without an agitator, but now using this machine is a breeze! I hope it lasts a lot longer than my last washer of a different make. It's super quiet and saves a lot of wash time and water! I would buy again.\n8: Over the years I have gone through Washing Machines and the last one was very short lived. Never have I had such an amazing appliance as this one. My first PQR appliance I love the large Deep Fill capacity and especially love the Impeller vs. Agitator function....Will definitely be a PQR Customer from now on.\n9: We bought this PQR washing machine because our other one was on vacation. My wife loves it! We’ll only buy PQR from now on !\n10: Having an LG with all the bells and whistles (that I never used), I wanted a basic machine that did what I needed it to do and this fit the bill. The pros are (i) its simplistic, (ii) no annoying buzzers/sounds, (ii) you can use hot on the quick cycle, (iii) the basket is not that deep so you can reach the bottom, (iv) it does a fantastic job cleaning, and (v) it has enough cycles to do what you need it to do (I only use normal and quick). The con are (i) it is very noisy compared to my LG, (ii) it vibrates a lot when it spins (which is actually a good thing), and (iii) the build quality is not the best. Overall, I like this washer as it functions as a washer and not an internet appliance.\n","Features customers liked about the washer: 1. The washer can handle large items like king-size blankets. 2.

"1: Works great! No leaks, sturdy build, relatively quiet, and efficient.\n2: This washer is amazing!! No center piece that clothes can get tangled on, and very spacious. The wash is efficient, quiet, and very good. I have never had a washer like this, and I’m so glad I have one now. I can put in very large loads and absolutely everything gets cleaned. Amazing!\n3: We couldn't be happier with this washer. It has all the features we could possibly want or need at any price. Although I initially wanted to get a front load washer, this model is very water and energy efficient with HUGE capacity for the largest comforter we own. Our previous washer had an agitator that loved to eat the pull cords on shorts and sweat pants, and destroy fine lingerie. The impeller design in this model works every bit as well, without the damage to our clothing. It's extremely quiet, too - which is great since we have a small home. And.. the problem with front loaders is they make a mess if you open them after starting a load. We shopped around and did a lot of research, and after finding this model, we were more than pleased to discover that PQR products are still made in the USA - buy American!!!\n","Features customers liked about the washer: 1.

While I've only had the washing maching a couple months, I love the more modern features. Not having an agitator (mine's an impeller) is so much gentler on my clothes. No more ties on clothes or thin items like tights and bras getting caught around the agitator and stretching.\n8: Good washer it holds my Queen comforter nicely…it seems to clean well it’s just very loud\n9: We purchased this washer to replace an old PQR that bit the dust.

"1: We've wanted a front load washer and found this one at a great deal. Didn't realize we got much more then what we paid for, so well worth the cost!\n2: It has a lot of options, doesn’t make much noise and very energy efficient.\n3: This is the first front loader washer We have owned and we can't believe the difference in how clean the clothes our.\n4: It’s fast, silent and doesn’t shake with heavy loads. So it’s great\n5: There are some negatives... I don't like the buttons at all. The styling is ugly. But mostly, it just works well! My clothes have all been cleaner and softer than with my old washing machine (which was a bit more expensive, had much nicer buttons, but had leaking issues within a few months and just died suddenly and unexpectedly at about 4 years old). I am not a huge user--I wash maybe a load or two a week--but I do have pets, which means I'm washing sheets pretty much weekly and there's a lot of fur. So far, the XYZ has been working like a dream.\n","Features customers liked about the product: 1. Energy efficiency 2. Large number of options 3. Quiet operation 4. Fast washing cycle 5. No shaking with heavy loads 6. Cleaning performance (clothes are cleaner and softer) Features customers did not like about the product: 1. Unattractive styling 2. Difficult to use buttons"
"1: My first front loader it is excellent! Energy saving!\n2: It has a lot of options, doesn’t make much noise and very energy efficient.\n3: I'm extremely happy with this machine for a variety of reasons. Firstly the capacity - I can easily wash my comforters at home now and that is a huge convenience especially with the pandemic. Secondly there are enough settings to meet all my needs without overwhelming me. Next the self clean cycle ensures that I am not washing my clothes in a dirty machine. Additionally its quiet and energy efficient. Overall a great machine.\n","Features customers liked about the product: 1. Energy saving 2. Large capacity 3. Variety of settings 4. Self-clean cycle 5.
